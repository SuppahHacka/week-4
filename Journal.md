#Week 4 thoughts

Although I did not complete all the tasks that were available, I still had time for self-reflection.

### Considerations 
- I mentioned in my notes how I was able to use excel to handle data entry at the clinic I work at. It made me realize that these tools aren't necessarily for digital historians, but a way to facilitate the 
work these historians do. It is like a screwdriver; the tool is not made for a handyman, but as a ressource for others to make use of. 
  - This was further proved in how voyant tools works as well. Voyant is more reliant on a complete source of data, where we can identify key words, repetitions, correlations etc... This makes it very useful for historians to identify the culture of multiple points in time. 
     - For example, we can use Voyant to mark the use of racist language through x range of time. The data can then be used to mark where the word is being used and historians can make use of this data to document factual historical events. 

### Reflection 
How digital historians argue history. 

When it comes to historical arguments, I have learned that there are two parties on the same side but on a different mission. 
- One group, the digital historians, argue historical evidence through the use of digital tools. Traditional historians are hardpressed to participate in these methods. 
- The biggest question is: how do digital historians make their case within the context of historical arguments? 
  - I believe it is within the transparency of the information you present. It is easy to claim monstrous things when you are using technology. It also makes it easier to present the information in a way that gives the author more credit than it is due. 
     - For this reason, it is in the favour of digital historians to preserve the historical evidence when digitizing it such that it remains neutral and is presented with authenticity. Fabrication of material is far too easy to come by nowadays. 

- Additionaly, I believe that what is missing within the historical argumentation are the conversations distorians (digital historians) should be having with historians about their work. By engaging in conversations, the expertise of both parties are shared and distorians can further advance their arguments by ensuring historians are on board with the accuracy and preservation of the information that is carried through the internet. 

# Conclusion

In a way, the fact the internet exists is digital history in itself. Soon, there will be a time where distorians get to crunching numbers and filtering historical nonsense fabricated by the bystanders of the internet community who peruse Reddit and 4chan to spread their content.
