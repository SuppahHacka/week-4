### Excel
Introduction to excel 

- As Dr. Graham mentioned, not many of us needed an introduction to how to use basic functions of Excel. 
- However, there is also much I do not know about the program that I was able to learn by myself due to my work. The filters are very useful and neat ways to select data that is needed to be handled in a certain way over other dates. 
  - Such as wanting to log appointments for clients and marking them as resolved in order of the date their appointments were booked. 
 - I do wish we saw how to clean up and sort information inside of a csv file. I know that regular excel docs respond much more properly than csv files.
